#### About  
Hello! I'm Linhao Li, a Data Science student at Chongqing University, currently pursuing an **B.S. in Data Science & Big Data Technology** (2022-2026 expected). I will also complete a **one-semester exchange program** in Computer Science at the **University of Macau** (2024 Fall).  

I'm actively seeking **2026 Fall Ph.D. positions** in **Computer Science** or **Artificial Intelligence**. \
Currently, I am actively seeking remote/on - site RA internship opportunities. I believe a short - term experience will help me better understand the group's research environment. Highly motivated, I aim to perform well and earn a return offer for long - term contribution.
